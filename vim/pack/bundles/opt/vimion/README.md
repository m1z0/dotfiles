Filetype recognition, syntax highlighting, and indentation for Ion files.

## EnvImprovement mirror

This is a mirror of EnvImprovement's
[VimIonSupport](https://w.amazon.com/index.php/EnvImprovementNinjas/VimIonSupport)
[files](https://code.amazon.com/packages/NinjaHooks/trees/HEAD/--/configuration/vim/amazon/ion),
to make it easy to install with Vim plugin managers like
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim),
[NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim), or
[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

## Requirements

Make sure that the following options are set in your `.vimrc`:

    syntax on
    filetype plugin indent on

Otherwise the filetype is not activated, and hence VimIon does not work.

## Installation

See the [VimIon wiki](https://w.amazon.com/index.php/VimIon) for installation
instructions.
